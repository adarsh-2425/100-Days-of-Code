# Inheritance

Inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming that allows a new class to be based on an existing class.     
The new class is called a derived class, while the existing class is called a base class.     
The derived class inherits all the data members and member functions of the base class, and can also add its own data members and member functions.    
Inheritance makes it possible to reuse code and create hierarchies of related classes.    
Access to the base class members from the derived class is controlled by access specifiers (public, protected or private).
