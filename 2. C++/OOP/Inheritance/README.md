# Inheritance

Inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming that allows a new class to be based on an existing class.     
The new class is called a derived class, while the existing class is called a base class.     
The derived class inherits all the data members and member functions of the base class, and can also add its own data members and member functions.    
Inheritance makes it possible to reuse code and create hierarchies of related classes.    
Access to the base class members from the derived class is controlled by access specifiers (public, protected or private).    

## Advantages

1. Code reuse: Inheritance allows you to reuse code from existing classes, reducing the amount of code you need to write from scratch. This can save time and effort, and also helps to ensure consistency and maintainability of the code.

2. Polymorphism: Inheritance enables polymorphism, which means that objects of derived classes can be treated as objects of the base class. This can simplify code and make it more flexible, because you can write code that works with a variety of objects that share a common interface.

3. Hierarchical organization: Inheritance makes it possible to create hierarchical relationships between classes, which can help to organize code and make it easier to understand. You can create a base class that defines common attributes and behaviors, and then create derived classes that specialize or extend those behaviors.
