# Water Plant

## Instructions
1.Define a function needs_water() that accepts:   

First argument: An int number of days since the previous watering.   
Second argument: A bool value is_succulent. (A value of true would indicate that the plant is a succulent.)   
Inside the function, you’ll need some conditional logic:  

If is_succulent is false and days is greater than 3, return "Time to water the plant.".   
If is_succulent is true and days is 12 or less, return "Don't water the plant!".   
If is_succulent is true and days is greater than or equal to 13, return "Go ahead and give the plant a little water.".   
Otherwise, return "Don't water the plant!".   

Note: Don’t print the strings; return them from the function.
