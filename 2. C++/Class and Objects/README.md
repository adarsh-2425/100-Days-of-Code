# CLASSES AND OBJECTS

## Review

Classes are user-defined types.   
Objects are instances of classes.   
Class members are the data attributes and functions inside of a class.    
Creating a new object from a class is called instantiation.     
Class members can be designated as either private or public â€” they are private by default.    
You can create a constructor to instantiate objects in a particular way.   
A destructor allows you to execute any cleanup necessary before an object gets destroyed.
